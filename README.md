# round_task

A simple experimental task management app inspired by [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) and the [round robin algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling).

This project is in early stage development. Designed based on problems I've faced when trying other existent solutions.
